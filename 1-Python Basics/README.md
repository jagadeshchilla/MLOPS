# Python Basics

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming. These are the essential building blocks that form the foundation for all Python development.

## What We've Learned

### 1.0 Syntax and Semantics
- **Python Syntax Rules**: Understanding how Python code is structured and written
- **Case Sensitivity**: Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different characters
- **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define code blocks and structure
- **Comments**: Using single-line comments with `#` to document code
- **Line Continuation**: Breaking long statements across multiple lines using backslash
- **Multiple Statements**: Writing multiple statements on one line using semicolons
- **Variable Assignment**: Creating and storing data in variables
- **Dynamic Typing**: Python automatically determines variable types at runtime
- **Type Inference**: How Python identifies data types without explicit declaration
- **Common Errors**: Understanding NameError and other basic syntax errors

### 1.1 Variables
- **Variable Creation**: Simple assignment using the `=` operator
- **Naming Conventions**: Rules for creating valid variable names
- **Case Sensitivity**: How different cases create different variables
- **Data Type Assignment**: Creating variables of different types (int, float, string, boolean)
- **Type Checking**: Using `type()` function to identify variable types
- **Type Conversion**: Converting between different data types using `str()`, `int()`, `float()`
- **Dynamic Typing**: How variables can change types during program execution
- **User Input**: Getting input from users and converting to appropriate types
- **Error Handling**: Understanding ValueError and invalid type conversions

### 1.2 Data Types
- **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers for counting and mathematical operations
- **Float (`float`)**: Decimal numbers for precise calculations and measurements
- **String (`str`)**: Text data for names, messages, and character sequences
- **Boolean (`bool`)**: Logical values `True` and `False` for conditions
- **Type Checking**: Identifying data types using the `type()` function
- **Type Conversion**: Converting between different data types safely
- **Common Errors**: Understanding TypeError when mixing incompatible types
- **String Concatenation**: Combining strings and handling type conversion errors

### 1.3 Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation
- **Division Types**: Understanding the difference between regular division (`/`) and floor division (`//`)
- **Comparison Operators**: Equality, inequality, greater than, less than, and their combinations
- **String Comparisons**: Case-sensitive comparison of text data
- **Logical Operators**: AND, OR, and NOT operations for combining conditions
- **Boolean Logic**: Truth tables and logical evaluation
- **Operator Precedence**: Understanding the order of operations
- **Practical Applications**: Using operators in real-world calculations and decision making

## Module Structure

- **1.0-basic.ipynb**: Introduction to Python syntax, semantics, and basic programming concepts
- **1.1-Variables.ipynb**: Variable declaration, assignment, naming, and type handling
- **1.2-Datatypes.ipynb**: Overview of Python's fundamental data types and their usage

## Key Takeaways

Understanding these fundamentals is crucial because they form the foundation for:
- Writing clean, readable Python code
- Making logical decisions in programs
- Performing mathematical computations
- Handling different types of data
- Building more complex programming structures
- Debugging and troubleshooting code issues

These concepts are the building blocks that enable you to progress to more advanced Python topics like control flow, data structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
