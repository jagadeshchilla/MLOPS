# Module 11: Working With Databases

## Overview

This module teaches you how to work with databases in Python using SQLite3. Learn to create, read, update, and delete data, manage database connections, and integrate databases into your applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Connect to SQLite databases using Python
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Design and create database schemas
- Handle database transactions and error handling
- Implement data validation and constraints
- Build database-driven applications

## Core Concepts

### SQLite Basics

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. It is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is embedded directly into the end program. It is a popular choice for local storage in web browsers, mobile devices, and desktop applications.

### Database Connection and Setup

Connecting to a database involves establishing a link between your Python application and the database file. This typically involves using a database driver (like `sqlite3` for SQLite) to open a connection. Once connected, you can obtain a cursor object, which allows you to execute SQL commands and fetch results. Database setup often includes creating tables with defined schemas, specifying column names, data types, and constraints (like primary keys and foreign keys) to ensure data integrity.

### CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, representing the four basic functions of persistent storage. These operations are fundamental to interacting with any database:
- **Create**: Inserting new records into a table.
- **Read**: Retrieving data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.
- **Update**: Modifying existing records in a table.
- **Delete**: Removing records from a table.

### Advanced Queries

Beyond basic CRUD operations, databases support advanced querying techniques to retrieve and manipulate data more complexly. This includes:
- **JOIN operations**: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
- **Complex filtering**: Using `WHERE` clauses with multiple conditions, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operators, and `LIKE` for pattern matching.
- **Aggregation**: Using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` to perform calculations on sets of rows.
- **Grouping**: Using `GROUP BY` to arrange identical data into groups.
- **Ordering**: Using `ORDER BY` to sort results.
- **Pagination**: Limiting and offsetting results to retrieve data in smaller, manageable chunks, which is crucial for large datasets.

### Context Managers and Connection Handling

Properly managing database connections is crucial to prevent resource leaks and ensure data consistency. Context managers (using `with` statements) provide a clean and reliable way to handle connections, ensuring that they are automatically closed even if errors occur. This pattern simplifies error handling and transaction management, making database interactions more robust.

### Data Validation and Models

Data validation involves ensuring that data conforms to specific rules and constraints before it is stored in the database. This helps maintain data quality and integrity. Data models, often implemented as classes or dataclasses in Python, represent the structure of your data and can incorporate validation logic. The Repository pattern is a design pattern that abstracts the data access layer, providing a clean API for interacting with the database without exposing the underlying database implementation details.
