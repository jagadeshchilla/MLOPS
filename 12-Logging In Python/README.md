## Logging Concepts

### Logging Basics

The Python logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from applications. Key components include:
- Loggers: The main interface for application code
- Handlers: Send log records to appropriate destinations
- Formatters: Specify layout of log messages
- Filters: Provide finer control over which records are logged

Log levels indicate the severity of messages:
- DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information
- INFO: General operational messages
- WARNING: Indicates something unexpected happened
- ERROR: Serious problem occurred
- CRITICAL: Very serious error, program may stop

### Advanced Logging

Python's logging system supports:
- Multiple loggers with hierarchical naming
- Different handlers for various output destinations
- Custom formatters for structured logging
- Filters to selectively process log records

The logging hierarchy allows parent loggers to propagate messages to child loggers, enabling flexible configuration.

### Real-World Application

Logging is typically integrated throughout an application to:
- Track application flow and state
- Record important events and decisions
- Capture errors and exceptions
- Monitor performance metrics

Effective logging provides visibility into application behavior and helps diagnose issues in production environments.

## Key Concepts to Remember

- Logging provides a systematic way to record application activity
- Different log levels serve different purposes in development and production
- Loggers can be organized hierarchically to match application structure
- Handlers determine where log messages are sent (console, file, etc.)
- Formatters control the appearance of log messages
- Filters allow selective processing of log records
