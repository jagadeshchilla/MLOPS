# Module 7: Exception Handling

## Overview

This module teaches you how to handle errors gracefully in Python programs. Learn to anticipate, catch, and handle exceptions to build robust and reliable applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand different types of exceptions in Python
- Use try-except blocks for error handling
- Create custom exceptions for specific use cases
- Implement proper exception handling strategies
- Debug and troubleshoot Python programs
- Write resilient code that handles edge cases

## Core Concepts

### Exception Basics

#### Basic Try-Except Structure
Exception handling in Python is primarily done using `try` and `except` blocks. Code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block. If an exception occurs, the code inside the corresponding `except` block is executed. You can catch specific types of exceptions to handle different error scenarios.

#### Complete Exception Handling
Beyond `try` and `except`, you can use `else` and `finally` blocks. The `else` block executes if no exception occurs in the `try` block. The `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or was handled, making it suitable for cleanup operations.

#### Exception Information
When an exception is caught, you can access information about it, such as its type and message. This information is useful for logging, debugging, and providing informative feedback to users.

### Custom Exceptions

#### Creating Custom Exception Classes
Python allows you to define your own custom exception classes by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Custom exceptions help in creating more readable and maintainable code by providing specific error types for your application's logic.

#### Exception Hierarchy
Custom exceptions can be organized into a hierarchy, inheriting from a common base exception class. This allows for more granular exception handling, where you can catch a base exception to handle a group of related errors, or catch specific subclasses for more precise handling.

## Key Exception Types

### Built-in Exceptions
Python provides a rich set of built-in exceptions for common error conditions, such as `ValueError` (when an operation receives an argument of correct type but inappropriate value), `TypeError` (when an operation is applied to an object of inappropriate type), `FileNotFoundError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, and many more.

### Exception Handling Patterns
Effective exception handling involves various patterns:
- **Specific exception handling**: Catching distinct exception types to provide tailored responses.
- **Exception chaining**: Using `raise ... from` to indicate that an exception was caused by another exception, preserving the original traceback.
- **Context managers for cleanup**: Using the `with` statement to ensure resources are properly acquired and released, even if exceptions occur.
