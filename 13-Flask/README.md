# 🌐 Module 13: Flask Web Development

## 📖 Overview

This module introduces Flask, a lightweight Python web framework for building web applications and APIs. It covers the core concepts required to create dynamic web pages, handle HTTP requests, and understand how Flask can be used for various web development tasks, including the deployment of machine learning models as web services.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- The fundamental principles of building web applications using the Flask framework.
- How to create RESTful APIs, particularly for machine learning model deployment.
- The mechanisms for handling different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- The use of Jinja2 templating for generating dynamic content.
- The process of serving static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) within a Flask application.
- The conceptual steps involved in deploying Flask applications for production environments.

## 📂 Module Contents

### 📁 flask/ Directory
This directory contains various Flask application examples demonstrating different features and functionalities of the framework.

### 📁 templates/ Directory
This directory is dedicated to HTML templates, which Flask uses with Jinja2 to render dynamic web pages.

### 📁 static/ Directory
This directory holds static assets such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images that are served directly by the web server.

## 📚 Detailed Content Guide

### Basic Flask Application
Understanding the minimal structure required to create a Flask application, including initializing the Flask app, defining routes, and returning responses.

### Advanced Routing
Exploring how Flask handles URL patterns, variable rules, and different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to direct incoming requests to appropriate functions.

### Form Handling
Concepts behind processing user input from web forms, including retrieving data from `request.form` and handling file uploads.

### Jinja2 Templating
Delving into Jinja2, Flask's default templating engine, to understand how to embed Python logic within HTML, use control structures (if/else, for loops), and display dynamic data.

### RESTful API Development
Concepts for building Web APIs using Flask, focusing on how to handle JSON data, respond to API requests, and structure endpoints for services like machine learning model serving.

## 🔗 Integration with MLOps

Flask plays a crucial role in MLOps pipelines by serving as the deployment layer for machine learning models. Key concepts include:

1.  **Model Serving**: Deploying trained machine learning models as accessible REST APIs.
2.  **Monitoring**: Integrating logging and metrics collection within Flask applications to monitor model performance and API usage.
3.  **A/B Testing**: Concepts of serving different versions of a model through Flask endpoints to facilitate A/B testing.
4.  **Batch Predictions**: Handling requests for bulk predictions through Flask APIs.
5.  **Model Updates**: Understanding how to update and hot-swap models in a running Flask application with minimal downtime.
